16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------
It showed me wall of texts with chapters and paragraphs; it looks like a book was written in the Terminal.

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
head pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince

books/other/pg1232.txt

19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
More and less takes me back to the story, which made me lost along the way. The spacebar was like a page down button and the q brings the prompt back.

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)

These commands just helps me get to where I need, especially if the text has thousands of words.
